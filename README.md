# QuickTerminate
Because sometimes, turning off the PC with the power button is just too mainstream. With **QuickTerminate**, your PC goes night-night faster than your Wi-Fi during a storm. One click, and *poof*â€”off it goes, like magic... 

Want to spice things up? Just slip this into the startup folder, sit back, and hope for the best. Because who needs a predictable boot-up anyway?
